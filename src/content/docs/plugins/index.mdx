import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import RequiredStar from "@vencord-docs/components/RequiredStar.astro"

## Prerequisites

- A [development Vencord install](/installing)
- VSCode with the extensions recommended by Vencord

Other knowledge requirements include:

- JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- Basic regex knowledge
- Basic knowledge of the command line
- Basic knowledge of how to use chrome devtools
- The ability to understand code from just reading it, without requiring documentation
- Basic react knowledge (if you want to do anything with ui)

## Plugin Setup

First, decide whether you want to use the `src/plugins` or `src/userplugins` folder.

### Official Plugins vs UserPlugins

<Tabs syncKey="plugins-type">
    <TabItem label="Plugin">
        Plugins inside `src/plugins` are tracked via git and are included in the official Vencord releases.

        Use this location if you intend to [submit your plugin for inclusion in Vencord](/plugins/submission).
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="UserPlugin">
        Plugins inside `src/userplugins` are private. They are not tracked via git.

        Use this location if you don't intend to submit your plugin for inclusion in Vencord.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

___

Once you have decided, create a folder with the name of your plugin inside the chosen directory.

The folder's name should be in camelCase. For example `myFirstPlugin` (NOT `MyFirstPlugin` or `my first plugin`)

### Plugin Structure

There are 3 special files you can create here:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="index.ts(x)" icon="seti:react">
        Your plugin's entry point. This is where most of your plugin's code will live and where you define things
        like its name and description.

        Code in this file runs in the browser, so you can use all browser APIs here.  
        Node.js APIs like `fs` or `child_process` are not available here.
        If you need them, you can do so in the `native.ts` file.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="README.md" icon="seti:markdown">
        Markdown documentation for your plugin. This file should contain a description
        of your plugin and instructions how to use it. Screenshots, videos or gifs
        are highly recommended. This will be used to generate a custom webpage for your plugin at
        https://vencord.dev/plugins/YourPlugin.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="native.ts" icon="seti:windows">
        Your plugin's native entry point.
        This code will run inside NodeJS instead of the browser.
        You can use all Node.JS apis here, such as `fs` or `child_process`.

        Browser APIs are not available here. If you need them, you can do so in the `index.ts` file.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Plugin Boilerplate

Start creating your plugin by adding an `index.ts` file inside your plugin's folder.

Type `vcPlugin` in the file, and you should automatically be suggested the "Define Plugin" template.

:::note
If this doesn't work for you, follow the [editor setup guide](/installing/editor-setup#installing-the-recommended-extensions)
to install the Vencord Companion extension.
:::

Now that you've done this, the file should look like this:

```ts
import { Devs } from "@utils/constants";
import definePlugin from "@utils/types";

export default definePlugin({
    name: "name",
    description: "description",
    authors: [Devs.author],
});
```

Fill out the `name` and `description` fields in the `definePlugin` call.

```ts "MyCoolPlugin" "I am very cute!"
export default definePlugin({
    name: "MyCoolPlugin",
    description: "I am very cute!",
    authors: [Devs.author],
});
```

For the authors property, how you do this will depend on whether you're making a plugin or a userplugin.

<Tabs syncKey="plugins-type">
    <TabItem label="Plugin">
        If this is your first time contributing, you will first have to add yourself to the `Devs` object. 
        It should already be imported, so just jump to its definition and add yourself to the object.
        Now, set authors to the new property!
        ```ts ins="Devs.YourName"
        export default definePlugin({
            name: "MyCoolPlugin",
            description: "I am very cute!",
            authors: [Devs.YourName],
        });
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="UserPlugin">
        Just set it to a plain object with your info:
        ```ts ins="{ name: \"Your Name\", id: 1234567890n }"
        export default definePlugin({
            name: "MyCoolPlugin",
            description: "I am very cute!",
            authors: [{ name: "Your Name", id: 1234567890n }],
        });
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Save your file and it should automatically format it and insert the following license header on the top.

<Code lang="ts" mark={["Vendicated and contributors"]} code={
`/*
 * Vencord, a Discord client mod
 * Copyright (c) ${new Date().getFullYear()} Vendicated and contributors*
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
 */`
}/>

If you want, you can change it from `Vendicated and contributors` to your own name.
But this is not strictly necessary, you own the code either way (and are already included in the "contributors" part).

:::note
If this doesn't work for you, follow the [editor setup guide](/installing/editor-setup#installing-the-recommended-extensions)
to set up linting.
:::

This is all of the boilerplate needed for a Vencord plugin. You can now start making your plugin!
